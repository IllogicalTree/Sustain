# Climate Impact Rating (CIR) Server

This project takes advantage of a PoC API starter kit that we modified to fit our needs. 

This solution starter was initially created at the United Nations Human Rights Office in Geneva, Switzerland on February 27-28, 2020, and built out over following 4 weeks. It features contributions by technologists from JPMorgan Chase, Persistent Systems, IBM, and Red Hat. 

Futher details and the original source are avaliable [here](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/solution-starter-kit-energy-2020).

## Deploy Instructions

API credentials should be added to the project in a "api_access.json" file.
